                <h2>
                    Perks that go with your team
                </h2>
                <p><strong>Great teamwork.</strong> For every project, we bring not only experience but also the great
                    teamwork we’ve been
                    nurturing for years. In fact, we at Mobikasa consider ourselves as one big team, not just a number
                    of
                    units. So when our hybrid team joins your project, they’ll be on the same page about the upcoming
                    gig
                    from day one.</p>

                <p><strong>Flawless communication.</strong> Our dedicated offshore developers come as a 100% extension
                    of your on-site team.
                    They are fully-synced and always available for a chat, whether it’s a daily standup, a code review
                    or an
                    important decision to be made. And if needed, they’ll be happy to drop by.</p>

                <p><strong>Control and flexibility.</strong> With Mobikasa’s staff augmentation services, you can easily
                    scale your
                    dedicated team up, as if you are managing your in-house team, only more flexible.</p>

                <p><strong>Startup mentality.</strong> We are part of your world. We know what you read, we know what
                    you eat. And, oh boy,
                    we love it. While some might be apprehensive about working on startup projects, our people are
                    thrilled
                    to jump on this bus and get totally blown away.</p>
